This is a PoC to maintain freshness of documentations in esa.io.
By including `Last checked at YYYY/MM/DD by @username` in the document,
the system detects documents that have been outdated for a certain period of time since the last check.

This is inspired by Google's efforts as described in "Software Engineering at Google".
